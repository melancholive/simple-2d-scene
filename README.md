#### _Tips_

2. [**Extra Credit**](#extra-credit)

### Requirement 1: _At Least Two Objects (25%)_

- There needs to be at least 2 different "objects" in the scene.
- Each object must use a different texture. These textures must _not_ be solid colours, but images. You may use any images that you like.
### Requirement 2: _Relative Position_ (25%)_

- At least one of your objects must be **transforming in relation to other objects** (i.e. translation).

### Requirement 3: _Movement (25%)_

- At least one of your objects must be **moving in relation to other objects** (i.e. translation).

### Requirement 4: _Rotation (25%)_

- At least one of your objects must be **rotating**.

### Common Issues

If your screen is flickering, remember that you have to, _in order_:

1. Call `glClear`.
2. Draw every single one of your objects (i.e. everything you want to be in your scene)
3. Call `SDL_GL_SwapWindow`.

### Extra Credit

- Have at least one of your objects change scale.
- Have _both_ of your objects translate in a pattern _other than_ vertically and horizontally.
